Goal:
- Gain experience with accessing APIs and using Python Selenium

Purpose:
- This is a python script that takes a youtube playlist and creates a folder named "mp3_folder" that has all the videos in the playlist converted to mp3s. 

Notes:
- If a video is too long (like over an hour), it may end up crashing

Next Steps:
- I guess the next step is to copy the mp3 folder into a place where you would want it. (but it seems hard to make it user-friendly)
